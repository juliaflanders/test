A template for a simple HTML site
====

This repository is intended as a starting point for a simple HTML web site using GitHub Pages. 
It contains some basic features that may be useful as starting points:
* an index page that serves as a home page for your site
* simple navigation links that you can expand as you add pages
* a template page that you can customize and then duplicate to create new pages
* a starter CSS file with basic styles that you can update
* for those working with TEI, a starter CSS file for TEI files that you can update to match your own encoding

To create a new site using this template, click "Use this template" and then choose "Create a new repository".

To publish the site and view it online:
* click on "Settings" and then select "Pages" in the left-hand navigation
* under "Build and deployment", in the section headed "Branch", click the dropdown menu that says "None", and select "main". Then click Save.
* at the top of the page, you should see "Your site is live at [URL]" (it may take a few minutes for the page to be generated, just be patient!).
